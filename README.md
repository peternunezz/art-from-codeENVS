## General Information

This repo is for ENVS193-DS, for UC Santa Barbara's Spring quarter. This 'Choose Your Own' assignment was to follow along Danielle Navarro's 'ART FROM CODE', a tutorial on using Rstudio to computer generate artwork. This course has entailed getting familiar with Rstudio, and utilizing it for statistical analyses, as well as statistical analysis outside of Rstudio. This assignment involved using Rstudio in a more creative and unique way, and strengthening my coding skills outside of statistical analysis. I followed along Navarro's 'Get Started' tutorial, then moved on to their 'Shading Tricks' tutorial, and their 'Pixel Filters' tutorial. I ended this repo by creating my own art work using different components of each tutorial listed above.

The 'art-from-code-CODE' file includes the Rproject. 
The 'art-from-code-DATA' file includes all the data used for the coding. I linked the data to this directory before the chunk where the data was used. The output for the last tutorial for 'Shading Tricks'  is also included in this file. 
All other files were created by Navarro.
